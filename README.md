# EE-104-Lab-8
The Web Crawl Q&A program requires a .env file containing an Openai API Key to run. Virtualenv, tiktoken, pandas openai, python-dotenv, bs4, matplotlib, plotly, scipy, sklearn - use-pep517, and -U scikit-learn scipy matplotlib also need to be installed. Cd is used to enter the directory, the environment is entered, and python web-qa.py is run from the terminal. When the file is run in the terminal, it should automatically scrape the web page listed in the Python file and write text based on the web page.

The File Q&A program requires two terminal windows to be run: a server and a client. An env file is added to the main directory containing an OpenAI API key, an OpenAI org key, a Pinecone API key, and a Pinecone environment. The config.yaml file in the server direction also needs the Pinecone API key, index name, and environment. Cd is used to enter the server directory, and pip install openai and npm install openai are run. A virtual environment is created and entered, and the app.py file is run in the terminal.

In the client window, the client directory is entered using cd. Pip install openai, npm install openai, and npm install are run, and npm run dev is used to activate the client. The user can then navigate to http://localhost:3000 to use the program, where a file can be uploaded and questions can be asked, which should be answered based on the uploaded file. A set of history essays is included for testing purposes.

The Kria traffic controller requires a circuit to be set up as can be seen in the video. A state machine is then run on the board to control the various circuit elements to produce the traffic controller.


Note: The traffic controller software has been uploaded by Maxim Vovenko, who I worked with for this lab.
